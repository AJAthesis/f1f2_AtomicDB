f1f2_AtomicDB
=============

This repository contains tabulations of the theoretical and empirical atomic scattering form factors for the elements. 
I include a simple mathematica worksheet that can be used to load and extract the data and plot it as needed.

The theoretical database was compiled from http://www.nist.gov/pml/data/ffast/index.cfm
